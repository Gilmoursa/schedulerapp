# schedulerapp
testing out some ideas to make an app to assign people tasks 


## How to Use
1. choose the number of people you wish to schedule
2. enter their names when prompted (you will be prompted to enter the number of names you chose in step 1)
3. create a task by name and assign it a number of hours you expect it to take
4. the app will list the name of the person performing the task beside the task name and how long it's estimated to take

## Features to Implement
### Phase 1
- add weekly availability per scheduler
- automatically balance the number of tasks (by hour) per scheduler
- improve formatting of generated-schedule (list tasks beneath each scheduler)

### Phase 2
- save data to database so multiple schedulers can view the schedule from their browser
- allow schedulers to mark tasks as completed (add strikethrough animation or grey-out text of completed task)
